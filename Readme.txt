Read the following before using the files within this archive.
 
1. This archive contains files that belong to the following articles in the Adobe Developer Connection:
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashmediaserver/articles/multicast_player_osmf.html
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashmediaserver/articles/multicast_streaming_osmf.html
 
 
Use these files with the articles to build a sample Open Source Media Framework (OSMF) multicast video streaming player with the use of the Flash Media Server Multicast Configuration tool, or a custom ActionScript-based configuration.
 
 
2. The archive file may be used in the following ways:
 
* The archive may be imported directly into Flash Builder. It contains two projects: OSMF_MulticastSample and OSMF_MulticastSample_COMPLETED. If you want to use Flash Builder for this sample, please follow the instructions on the "Setting up the project" section of either article.
 
* You may unpackage the archive to a desired working directory manually, and utilize the files directly with Flash Professional. 
 
The two different folders/projects within the archive represent the start (OSMF_MulticastSample) or the completed (OSMF_MulticastSample_COMPLETED) sample files. If you want to follow along with the article and perform the steps, use the OSMF_MulticastSample folder. If you want to review the completed code, use the OSMF_MulticastSample_COMPLETED folder.
 
Both folders contain the same structure and base assets. Most of the pertinent files are located in the src/ subdirectory.
